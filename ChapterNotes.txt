Ch 2 --> Linked List 

Linked list represent sequence of Nodes. 
Single linked list --> each node point to next node in the list
Doubly LL --> each node points to both next node and previous node in the list.

No constant time element access in LL. means, to find Kth element we need to iterate through K element.

Benefit of LL --> you can add and remove items from the begining of LL in constant time. This is useful for many specific applications.
